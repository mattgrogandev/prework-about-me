      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I have been working as a realtor for the past 7.5 years and am looking for a career change. I am excited to learn all that this program has to offer and start working in the field upon completion of the program. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Tucson, AZ</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Golf, hiking, taking my dog to the park, pickle ball, video games, traveling, and some more I'm probably not thinking of right now.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would love to own my own company some day and generate enough money that I can comfortably travel whenever I want.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I'm going to stay in Tucson for a while but eventually would like to be in San Diego.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I feel like I'm pretty good with tech overall, I'd like to get better at it and I realize how many job opportunities there are in this field once I learn the necessary skills. I like to problem-solve and it seems like that is one of the main aspects of this job. Also, eventually I'd love to start my own company and having these skills will allow me to create something on my own.</p>
